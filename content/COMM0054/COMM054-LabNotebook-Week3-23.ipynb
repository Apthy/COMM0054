    "A Matplotlib figure can be categorised into several parts.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Figure**: It is a whole figure which may contain one or more than one Axes (plots). You can think of a Figure as a canvas which contains plots.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Axes**: It is what we generally think of as a plot. A Figure can contain many Axes. Each Axes contains two or three (in the case of 3D) Axis objects and has a title, an x-label and a y-label.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Axis**: They are the number-line like objects and take care of generating the graph limits.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Artist**: Everything which one can see on the figure is an artist like Text objects, Line2D objects, collection objects. Most Artists are tied to Axes.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, Matplotlib graphs your data on Figures (i.e., windows, Jupyter widgets, etc.), each of which can contain one or more Axes (i.e., an area where points can be specified in terms of x-y coordinates (or $\\theta$-r in a polar plot, or x-y-z in a 3D plot, etc.). "

    "We start some basic usage patterns and best-practices to help get started with Matplotlib. We will be using the **matplotlib.pyplot** module, which provides simple functions to add plot elements like lines, images, text, etc. to the current Axes in the current Figure. \n",
    "\n",
    "In its simplest use, pyplot maintains an internal state in which you build up visualisation step by step. Once you are done, you can save it (by `savefig()`) or display it (by `show()`). \n"
